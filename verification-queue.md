# Verification Queue

Facts marked `[требует верификации]` that need cross-reference or primary-source confirmation. Format per `vault-protocol.md` §3.7.

Items are added during regular iterations. Closed in batches during `mode: verification` iterations.

## High priority

## vq-001 [high priority]
- **Fact**: "How a Polish `karta pobytu` / Polish non-TP residence interacts with a move to Greece and with DN or TP options"
- **Country**: Greece
- **Section**: 5.1
- **Current source**: src-001, src-002, src-005
- **Why uncertain**: Current sources confirm the one-Member-State rule for temporary protection, but do not explicitly explain how a Polish residence permit that is not TP affects long-stay residence planning in Greece.
- **Suggested verification**: Check Greek consular guidance, EU long-stay mobility rules, or a current Greek immigration-lawyer explainer.
- **Created**: 2026-05-24 (run-002)
- **Status**: resolved
- **Resolved**: 2026-05-25 (run-005)
- **Resolution note**: The Greece profile now makes the operational answer explicit: a Polish residence title does not replace the need for a Greek status, and if the Polish status is itself temporary protection, Greece's one-Member-State TP rule blocks a second Greek TP file. [src-001][src-002][src-003]

## vq-002 [high priority]
- **Fact**: "Exact Greek DN document checklist, fees, apostille/translation requirements from an official-primary source"
- **Country**: Greece
- **Section**: 5.1
- **Current source**: src-003, src-004
- **Why uncertain**: MFA confirms the route exists, but this iteration did not capture a full primary-source checklist.
- **Suggested verification**: Find a Greek consulate page or ministry circular with document-by-document requirements.
- **Created**: 2026-05-24 (run-002)
- **Status**: pending

## Medium priority

## vq-003 [medium priority]
- **Fact**: "Exact sunny days per year for Athens, Thessaloniki, and Heraklion"
- **Country**: Greece
- **Section**: 5.2
- **Current source**: src-008, src-009, src-010
- **Why uncertain**: Current climate sources provide temperatures, humidity, and sunshine hours but not direct sunny-day counts in machine-readable form.
- **Suggested verification**: Find a source that exposes explicit day counts (meteoblue chart data, HNMS climate atlas, or another statistical source).
- **Created**: 2026-05-24 (run-002)
- **Status**: pending

## vq-004 [medium priority]
- **Fact**: "Spain's official post-04 March 2027 transition path from Ukrainian temporary protection into an ordinary residence permit, if any"
- **Country**: Spain
- **Section**: 5.1
- **Current source**: src-002, src-011, src-012
- **Why uncertain**: This iteration confirmed current TP rights and the 04 March 2027 horizon, but did not find an official Spanish bridge equivalent to Greece's Article 194 mechanism.
- **Suggested verification**: Check Ministry of Inclusion / UGE-CE / immigration-law updates for an explicit TP conversion route or transitional instruction.
- **Created**: 2026-05-24 (run-003)
- **Status**: pending

## vq-005 [medium priority]
- **Fact**: "How a Polish `karta pobytu` or other existing EU residence interacts with Spain-based TP or digital nomad residence planning"
- **Country**: Spain
- **Section**: 5.1
- **Current source**: src-011, src-012, src-013
- **Why uncertain**: Current Spanish sources document TP and DN separately but do not explicitly explain how an existing Polish residence title affects the move.
- **Suggested verification**: Check Spanish consular guidance, UGE-CE materials, or a current Spanish immigration-lawyer explainer.
- **Created**: 2026-05-24 (run-003)
- **Status**: resolved
- **Resolved**: 2026-05-25 (run-005)
- **Resolution note**: Spain's DN route remains a Spanish status with its own NIE and visa requirements, so a Polish residence title does not substitute for Spanish authorization; if the Polish status is TP, the EU one-Member-State TP rule remains the safe planning baseline. [src-002][src-013]

## vq-006 [medium priority]
- **Fact**: "Exact sunny days per year for Madrid, Valencia, and Málaga"
- **Country**: Spain
- **Section**: 5.2
- **Current source**: src-025
- **Why uncertain**: Resolved. Current Results provides direct annual clear-day counts for all three target cities.
- **Suggested verification**: none
- **Created**: 2026-05-24 (run-003)
- **Status**: resolved
- **Resolved**: 2026-05-25 (run-005)
- **Resolution note**: Current Results reports 97 clear days/year for Madrid, 91 for Valencia, and 107 for Málaga, which is sufficient to pass the climate DoD for Spain's section 5.2. [src-025]

## vq-007 [high priority]
- **Fact**: "Official-primary Portugal D8 / remote-work residence checklist, income-proof mechanics, and filing route"
- **Country**: Portugal
- **Section**: 5.1
- **Current source**: src-026
- **Why uncertain**: Resolved for the post-visa filing stage. AIMA now provides an official-primary filing route and document list for the remote-work residence-authorization stage.
- **Suggested verification**: none
- **Created**: 2026-05-24 (run-004)
- **Status**: resolved
- **Resolved**: 2026-05-25 (run-005)
- **Resolution note**: AIMA confirms that the post-visa route is filed by appointment/in person (with e-platform rollout noted for residence-visa holders) and requires a valid passport, valid remote-work residence visa, foreign employer/client declaration, and residence-address evidence. [src-026]

## vq-008 [high priority]
- **Fact**: "Portugal's official post-04 March 2027 transition path from Ukrainian temporary protection into an ordinary residence permit, if any"
- **Country**: Portugal
- **Section**: 5.1
- **Current source**: src-002, src-017, src-019
- **Why uncertain**: This iteration confirmed the current TP framework and 2027 horizon, but did not find a Portuguese bridge equivalent to Greece's Article 194 mechanism.
- **Suggested verification**: Check AIMA, gov.pt, Diário da República, or ministry guidance for an explicit TP conversion route or transitional instruction.
- **Created**: 2026-05-24 (run-004)
- **Status**: pending

## vq-009 [medium priority]
- **Fact**: "How a Polish `karta pobytu` or other existing EU residence interacts with Portugal-based TP or D8 planning"
- **Country**: Portugal
- **Section**: 5.1
- **Current source**: src-017, src-020
- **Why uncertain**: Current sources explain Portugal's TP and D8 frameworks separately but do not explicitly address how an existing Polish residence title changes the move.
- **Suggested verification**: Check Portuguese consular guidance, AIMA materials, or a current Portugal immigration-lawyer explainer.
- **Created**: 2026-05-24 (run-004)
- **Status**: resolved
- **Resolved**: 2026-05-25 (run-005)
- **Resolution note**: Portugal's remote-work path is a Portuguese residence visa plus a Portuguese AIMA residence-authorization filing, so an existing Polish residence title does not substitute for Portuguese authorization; if the Polish status is TP, the EU one-Member-State TP rule remains the safe planning baseline. [src-002][src-026]

## vq-010 [medium priority]
- **Fact**: "Exact sunny days per year for Lisbon, Porto, and Faro"
- **Country**: Portugal
- **Section**: 5.2
- **Current source**: src-022, src-023, src-024
- **Why uncertain**: Current climate sources provide temperatures, humidity, and sunshine-hour intensity, but not direct annual sunny-day counts.
- **Suggested verification**: Find a source that exposes explicit day counts (for example meteoblue chart data, IPMA climatology tables, or another statistical source).
- **Created**: 2026-05-24 (run-004)
- **Status**: pending

## vq-011 [high priority]
- **Fact**: "Italy's official post-04 March 2027 transition path from Ukrainian temporary protection into an ordinary residence permit, if any"
- **Country**: Italy
- **Section**: 5.1
- **Current source**: src-002, src-027, src-034
- **Why uncertain**: This iteration confirmed the TP horizon through 04 March 2027 and captured UNHCR's no-current-conversion baseline, but did not find an Italian bridge equivalent to Greece's Article 194 mechanism.
- **Suggested verification**: Check Ministry of Interior, Questura / Polizia di Stato, Integration Migrants, and Official Gazette updates for any explicit TP conversion or transitional route.
- **Created**: 2026-05-25 (run-006)
- **Status**: pending

## vq-012 [medium priority]
- **Fact**: "Italy digital nomad / remote-worker visa 2026 income threshold and family-dependent mechanics for a Ukrainian applicant, including unmarried partner eligibility"
- **Country**: Italy
- **Section**: 5.1
- **Current source**: src-028
- **Why uncertain**: The captured consular checklist gives a 2024 income floor and names spouse/minor children for family sponsorship, but the route needs a 2026 consular cross-check and a clearer answer for an unmarried partner.
- **Suggested verification**: Check an Italian consulate serving Ukraine/Poland, Visa for Italy, and Questura guidance or a current Italian immigration-lawyer explainer.
- **Created**: 2026-05-25 (run-006)
- **Status**: pending

## vq-013 [high priority]
- **Fact**: "Cyprus-specific official post-04 March 2027 transition path from Ukrainian temporary protection into ordinary residence, if any"
- **Country**: Cyprus
- **Section**: 5.1
- **Current source**: src-002, src-036
- **Why uncertain**: EU-level temporary protection is extended to 04 March 2027, but the captured Cyprus Asylum Service local page still states the earlier 04 March 2026 extension and no Cyprus TP-to-ordinary-residence bridge was captured.
- **Suggested verification**: Check Cyprus Asylum Service, Deputy Ministry of Migration and International Protection, Migration Department news, Council of Ministers decisions, and Cyprus legal updates for a 2027 local implementation page or transition rule.
- **Created**: 2026-05-25 (run-007)
- **Status**: pending

## vq-014 [medium priority]
- **Fact**: "Direct annual sunny-day counts for Nicosia, Limassol/Larnaca, and Paphos"
- **Country**: Cyprus
- **Section**: 5.2
- **Current source**: src-039
- **Why uncertain**: Current climate source provides temperatures, humidity, precipitation days, and annual sun hours, but not direct annual sunny-day counts for the target cities.
- **Suggested verification**: Check Cyprus Meteorological Service climate normals, WMO city climate pages, meteoblue chart data, or another statistical source with explicit sunny/clear-day counts.
- **Created**: 2026-05-25 (run-007)
- **Status**: pending
